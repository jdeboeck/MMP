The instance file for the electricity network problem is as follows:


m n o D
x y Power
...
x y Consumption
...
edge0 edge 1
...

Each .dat file has 1+m+n+o lines.

The idea is that provider are numbered in {0,1,...,m-1} and consumers are numbered in {m, m+1,..., m+n-1}.

Where m is the number of providers, n is the number of customers
o is the number of connections, and D is the maximum lenght of a path between a provider and a customer

Then, the coordinates and the power delivered by each provider is displayed on m lines

The coordinates and the power consumed by each consumer is displayed on n lines

The connections are displayed on o lines, where a connection is modeled as an undirected edge.
